Introduction
------------

-   Watch the [introduction lecture](parts/intro.html).

-   What is Ruby?

    -   Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, open source language.

-   What is Rails?

    -   Rails is a web application framework

-   Versions

    -   The newest version of Ruby is 1.9, the old version is 1.8 (1.9
        is not fully backward-compatible with 1.8 so not everyone
        switched from 1.8).
    -   The newest version of Rails is 3.2, the old version is 2.x (3.2
        is not fully backward-compatible with 2.x so not everyone
        switched from 2.x).

-   Gems

    -   Packaged modules of ruby code (sort of like C\# DLLs but also
        include the code)

-   Installing Ruby On Rails

    -   Windows - [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org/)
    -   Linux/Mac - Rvm Ruby Version Manager - allows running multiple
        versions of Ruby on the same machine (so people can run legacy
        Ruby 1.8 web apps and new 1.9 web apps side-by-side).

-   Development Environment, you can use whatever you want:

    -   Vim
    -   Sublime Text =\> recommended for beginners
    -   RubyMine
    -   NotePad++
