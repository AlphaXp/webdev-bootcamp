Part 5 - RSpec (TDD)
====================



Demonstration
-------------

-   How to run rspec:

        rspec file_spec.rb

-   [String Calcluator
    kata](http://www.21apps.com/agile/tdd-kata-by-example-video/):

    -   Add(string numbers)

        -   "" =\> 0
        -   "1" =\> 1
        -   "1,2" =\> 3
        -   "1,2,3....."
        -   "1\\n,2,3"
        -   "1,\\n" =\> raise ArgumentError
        -   "1,2,-4" =\> raise ArgumentError(negatives are not allowed)

-   Client and Order, when creating an order, it sets the associated
    client.

Exercise 1
----------

-   Implement [Conway's Game of
    Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using TDD
    and rspec.

Exercise 2
----------

In this exercise, you will implement a simple shop, with a shopping
cart, products and orders.

-   Implement the following menu:

        1. Add product
        2. List all products
        3. Add to shopping cart
        4. Empty shopping cart
        5. Checkout
        0. Exit

    -   The "Checkout" item:

        -   asks the user for a credit card number
        -   creates an order from the shopping cart
        -   moves the line items to the new order
        -   empties the cart in the session

-   Notes:

    -   Add these three ActiveRecord models to store the data:

        -   Order (fields: credit\_card)
        -   Product (fields: name, price)
        -   LineItem (fields: order\_id, product\_id, quantity)

    -   Use these classes:

        -   ShoppingCart

            -   add(product/product\_id, quantity)
            -   empty!
            -   empty?
            -   checkout! (returns Order)

        -   Store

            -   menu

Exercise 3
----------

-   Extend the previous exercise:

    -   Modify the `checkout!` method:

        -   After the order is created it should bill the credit card
            for the sum of the order by calling the
            `Billing.bill(credit_card, sum)` method

        -   don't implement Billing, use a stub of it:

{% highlight ruby linenos%}
Billing.should_receive(:bill).with(arg1, ...)
{% endhighlight%}

    -   Add a `sum` method to the Order model
