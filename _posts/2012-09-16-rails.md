Part 6 - Rails
==============

[Back](../index.html)

Introduction
------------

### Demonstration

-   Create a rails applications:

        rails new application-name -T

    (-T = skip Test::Unit testing framework, we're gonna use rspec
    instead)

-   Add rspec and haml

    -   add "rspec-rails" to Gemfile (in the :development and :test
        group)
    -   add "haml-rails" to Gemfile (in the :development and :test
        group)
    -   run `bundle`
    -   run `rails generate rspec:install`

-   Change default SASS/SCSS format to sass by adding this line to
    *config/environments/development.rb*

{% highlight ruby linenos%}
config.sass.preferred_syntax = :sass
{% endhighlight%}

-   Run development server:

        rails server

-   Add a home controller with an index action:

        rails generate controller home index

-   Make it the default action by deleting *public/index.html* and
    adding this line to *config/routes.rb*:

{% highlight ruby linenos%}
root to: 'home#index'
{% endhighlight%}

-   Create a scaffold:

        rails generate scaffold ModelName field1:type1 field2:type2

-   Layouts

-   Watch the [Understanding the Asset Pipeline
    screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/279-understanding-the-asset-pipeline).

### Why is the rspec-rails gem in both :test and :development?

It's pretty obvious why the :test group is required (in order to run
tests),

but why is the :development group required?

Well, it's because of the rails generators, when you run
`rails generate scaffold ModelName ...`:

> -   if "rspec-rails" isn't in the :development group, rails will
>     create Test::Unit tests.
> -   if "rspec-rails" is in the :development, rails will create RSpec
>     tests.

### Exercise

-   Read chapters 1-9 of [Action Controller
    Overview](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html)
-   Read [Layouts and
    Rendering](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html)
-   Read [Form Helpers](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html)

-   Start writing PizzaBurger for pizzas only (call the order class
    `Order`):

    -   Create a home controller with an index action/view with this
        menu:

        -   Add a client
        -   Show all clients
        -   Order a pizza

            -   the client should be a combobox selector

        -   Show all orders

            -   will show all of the orders with an option to edit and
                to cancel

    -   Use haml and sass like in the demonstration
    -   Use the `rails generate scaffold` command to create the `Order`
        and `Client` class

Twitter Bootstrap + Simple Form
-------------------------------

### Demonstration

-   Watch the [Simple Form
    screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/234-simple-form-revised)

    -   Add `gem "simple_form"` to the Gemfile
    -   Run `bundle`
    -   Run `rails g simple_form:install --bootstrap`

-   Twitter Bootstrap

    -   Add `gem "bootstrap-sass"` to the Gemfile
    -   Run `bundle`
    -   Add the following to the beginning of the application.css.sass

{% highlight css linenos%}
        @import "bootstrap" 
        @import "bootstrap-responsive"
{% endhighlight%}
    -   Delete everything from `scaffolds.css.sass`

-   The demo code is here:
    [https://github.com/elentok/pizzaburger](https://github.com/elentok/pizzaburger)

### Exercise

-   Go to [Twitter Bootstrap
    homepage](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for reference.
-   Go to [Simple Form
    homepage](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) for
    reference.
-   Use SimpleForm and Bootstrap

Partial Templates
-----------------

### Exercise

-   Read [Using
    Partials](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#using-partials)
    (only chapter 3.4).

-   When showing a client, also show all of his orders

    -   Extract a partial template called "\_list" from the order's
        "index" template.
    -   Render the "\_list" template from the client's "show" template.

Localization
------------

### Demonstration

-   Watch the [I18n
    screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/138-i18n-revised).

### Exercise

-   Read [Rails Internationalization
    API](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html).
-   Make PizzaBurger support both hebrew and english.

RSpec + Spork + FactoryGirl
---------------------------

### Demonstration

-   Automatically generated spec files
-   Add spork:

    -   add the gem "spork" under :development and :test
    -   run:

            bundle
            spork rspec --bootstrap

    -   edit "spec\_helper.rb" and put everything that comes after the
        "---- Instructions ----" comment into the `Spork.prefork` block

    -   add the following line into the `Spork.each_run` block:

            Dir.glob("#{::Rails.root}/app/models/*.rb").each { |file| load "#{file}" }

    -   edit the `.rspec` file in the root of your projects and add
        "--drb"
    -   run `spork`

-   Add factory girl:

    -   add the gem "factory\_girl\_rails" under :development and :test
    -   run `bundle`
    -   add the following line into the `Spork.each_run` block:

            FactoryGirl.factories.clear
            Dir.glob("#{::Rails.root}/spec/factories/*.rb").each { |file| load "#{file}" }

    -   restart spork

-   To create a new factory run:

        rails g factory_girl:model ModelName

-   To run the specs, run `rake spec`

-   [more information about spork](https://github.com/sporkrb/spork)

### Exercise

-   Read [Getting started with
    factory\_girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md)
-   Make all the specs pass

Inheritance
-----------

### Demonstration

-   Using one controller for multiple inheriting classes

### Exercise

-   Add burger orders:

    -   Add the `BurgerOrder` and `PizzaOrder` classes that inherit from
        `Order` (use single-table inheritance)
    -   Add "Order a burger" to the menu
    -   In the order controller's "new" action, decide which order to
        create by using a query parameter
    -   In the order form view, decide which fields to show by checking
        the type of the object

Coffeescript & AJAX
-------------------

### Exercise

-   In the order form, add a button near the client selector that will
    allow you to add a new client without leaving the form:

    -   Use [Twitter Bootstrap's Modal JS
        plugin](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#modals)
        to open the new client popup.
    -   Use [$.ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/) to save the new
        client to the server (send a POST request to the `/clients`
        path).
    -   Write your coffeescript code in
        `app/assets/javascripts/orders.js.coffee` (you can put the code
        for the new client form in `clients.js.coffee` if you want).

Authentication
--------------

### Demonstration

-   Watch [Authentication from
    scratch](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised)

    Devise](http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-introducing-devise)
-   Watch [Customizing
    Devise](http://railscasts.com/episodes/210-customizing-devise)

-   Create two types of users:

    -   Client - use the existing class (either combine Client and
        User).
    -   Employee

CanCan
------

### Demonstration

-   Watch [Authorization with
    CanCan](http://railscasts.com/episodes/192-authorization-with-cancan)

    -   Client

        -   Can create orders and edit its own orders

    -   Employee - allowed to view all orders and add clients

        -   Can do anything
