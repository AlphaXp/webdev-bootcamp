Appendix 1 - Linux
------------------

### Important differences between Unix and Windows

#### Drives and Directory tree

There is notion of drive C:, D:, etc. The directory tree has a single
root, and it looks like this:

> -   `/bin` - basic shell commands (ls, mv, cp, mkdir, ...)
> -   `/sbin` - hardcore system binaries (file system stuff, low-level
>     hardware management, ...)
> -   `/lib` - low-level libraries (kernel modules, ...)
> -   `/dev` - ??? (how to explain...)
> -   `/proc` - ??? (how to explain...)
> -   `/var` - cache, logs, etc...
> -   `/tmp` - temporary files
> -   `/usr` - application-level
>
>     -   `/usr/bin` - application binaries
>     -   `/usr/lib` - application libraries
>     -   `/usr/share` - application resources
>
>         -   `/usr/share/doc` - application documentation
>
> -   `/home` - contains the home directories of each user:
>
>     -   when logged in as the user "bob", the environment variable
>         $HOME will usually be "/home/bob"
>     -   the home directory can be referenced using the tilda (\~)
>         symbol, so running:
>
>             cd ~/projects/myproject
>
>         will change the current directory to
>         */home/bob/projects/myproject*
>
#### File system permissions

> -   each file is owned by a user
> -   each file belongs to a group
> -   there are 3 types of permissions:
>
>     -   read (r)
>     -   write (w)
>     -   execute (x)
>
>         -   when a file is set as executable you can run it by typing
>             `./filename` in the terminal
>         -   when a directory is set as executable you can open it and
>             see its contents
>
> -   these three permissions are defined for these three entities:
>
>     -   owner - the user that owns this file
>     -   group - the group this file belongs to
>     -   other - all other users
>
> -   you can see the permissions of a file by running `ls -l`
> -   if I run `ls -l` on this document's directory I will get the
>     following:
>
>         drwxrwxr-x 2 david david  4096 Apr 29 16:07 exercises
>         -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david   720 Apr 30 09:24 Guardfile
>         -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david 18493 May  2 09:48 index.html
>         -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david 10212 May  2 09:48 index.rst
>         -rw-rw-r-- 1 david david   259 Apr 30 09:19 README
>         -rwxrwxr-x 1 david david  2089 Apr 30 09:16 rst2html-pygments.py
>         drwxrwxr-x 2 david david  4096 May  1 16:53 style
>
>     these are the permissions on the "index.rst" file are
>     "-rw-rw-r--":
>
>     -   the owner (david) can read and write it
>     -   the group (david) can read and write it (yes, the group is
>         also called "david", when installing Ubuntu it automatically
>         creates a user and a group by the same name).
>     -   other users can only read it
>
> -   sometimes you might see permissions written using 3 digits, like
>     754:
>
>     -   each digit is actually the sum of the following:
>
>         -   executable = 1
>         -   writeable = 2
>         -   readable = 4
>
>     -   the 1st digit is the user permissions
>     -   the 2st digit is the group permissions
>     -   the 3st digit is the permissions for all other users
>
>     -   so 754 means:
>
>         -   read/write/execute-able by the user (7=1+2+4)
>         -   read/execute-able by the group (5=1+4)
>         -   readable by other users (4)
>
#### Misc

1.  file names are case sensitive, so a directory can contain two files
    named "Bob" and "bob".

### Important Linux commands

-   To see help for a command just run "`name-of-command --help`"
-   `ls` - shows a list of the files in the current directory
-   `cd /path/to/other/directory` - changes the current directory
-   `pwd` - shows the current directory
-   `chmod` - changes the permissions on a file, examples:

    -   `chmod u=rwx myfile` - make myfile read/write/execute-able by
        the owning user
    -   `chmod g=rx myfile` - make myfile read/execute-able by the group
    -   `chmod o=r myfile` - make myfile readable by all other users
    -   `chmod -R u=rwx mydir` - make mydir and all of its contents
        (files and directories) read/write/execute-able by the owning
        user.

-   `rm file` - delete a file

    -   `rm -R dir` - delete a directory and all of its contents

-   `mv source-file target-file` - moves (or renames) a file
-   `mv source-file target-directory/` - moves the files into
    *target-directory*
-   `cp source-file target-file` - copy a file
