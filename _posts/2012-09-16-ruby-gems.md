Part 2 - Ruby Gems
==================

[Back](../index.html)

Demonstration
-------------

-   difference between `require`, `require_relative` and `load`:

    -   `require 'name'` - relative to $LOAD\_PATH
    -   `require './...'` - relative to the curent working path
    -   `require_relative '...'` - relative to the path of the current
        file
    -   `load '...'` - loads a file (even if it's already loaded)

-   install a gem
-   create a Gemfile
-   run bundle install
-   use Gemfile groups
-   watch the [bundler
    screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/201-bundler-revised).

Read
----

-   A gem is a ruby plugin
-   To install a single gem:

        gem install gem-name-here

-   A single project uses multiple gems and in order to manage gem
    dependencies and simplify deployment of a rails app we use a tool
    called *Bundler*.

-   Bundler uses a file called *Gemfile*:

{% highlight ruby linenos%}
# this line tells bundler to use "http://rubygems.org" as the gem repository
# (if you wish to use an offline repository, replace this url with your own)
source 'http://rubygems.org'

# this tells bundler to load the "rails" gem and all of its dependencies
gem 'rails'

# these gems will only be required for development 
# (when deploying a production environment these won't be loaded)
group :development do
  gem 'debugger'
  gem 'guard-livereload'
end
{% endhighlight%}

-   After creating the Gemfile, run the command `bundle install` to
    install the gems.

Exercise 2
----------

-   Create a new folder
-   Create a file called "Gemfile" and the following gems to it:

    -   rails
    -   rspec-rails
    -   debugger

-   Run `bundle install`, you should see "Your bundle is complete! ..."

**Notes:**

-   If it complains that there is no source, then add the source line
    (`source 'url-for-gem-server'`) at the beginning of the file.

-   You can run a local gem server by running `gem server` in a terminal
    (the url for this server will be *http://localhost:8808*).
