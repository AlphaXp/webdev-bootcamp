Part 8 - Git
============

[Back](../index.html)

Demonstration
-------------

-   What is git?
-   Initializing a repository
-   What is the index? (staging)
-   Commiting
-   Pushing changes
-   Branches
-   Merging
-   Rebase
-   Resolving conflicts

Exercise
--------

-   Read
    [http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide)/

### Part 1

-   Configuring user and email (these will be assigned to all your
    commits):

        git config --global user.name 'My Name'
        git config --global user.email 'me@myhost.com'

-   Create a repository (`git init`)
-   Add some files, and run `git status` (you'll see the new files under
    "untracked files")
-   now commit:

        git add --all
        git commit -m "commit message"

-   Change one of the files
-   Use `git diff` to see the changes
-   Add those changes to the index file (`git add {file}`)
-   Run `git diff`, you can see your working directory has no changes
    (git diff shows the changes between your working directory and the
    staging area)

### Part 2

-   Create a bare repository (`git init --bare`), we'll call it
    **REPO0**
-   Clone that repository
    (`git clone path-to-other-repo0 name-of-cloned-repo`), we'll call it
    **REPO1**, this will create the new repository in
    `name-of-cloned-repo`.
-   Make some commits and push them (`git push -u origin master`)
-   Make some commits and push them (`git push` - after pushing with
    `-u`, you don't need to add the `-u origin master` part anymore)
-   Clone the first repository again (in a different directory), we'll
    call this one **REPO2**
-   Make some commits in REPO2, and push them to REPO0
-   Go back to REPO1 and pull the changes

### Part 3

-   In groups:

    -   Create a remote repository (using github, bitbucket, SCM
        manager, etc...)
    -   Each member of the group should clone the repository
    -   Each member should commit once and push (use rebase to handle
        conflicts)
    -   Each member should commit multiple times (change all existing
        files) and push
